# CyTrition
This is an Android application that I delevoped as part of a group for COMS 309. 
My fellow group members were Ravi Patel and Sushanth Sangem. 
The 'server files' directory contains the files that were placed on the server and
the 'cytitionapp' directory (which was a typo) contains the android application files.
To run the program import the 'cytitionapp' into Android Studio. Unfortunately, the
functionality was dependent on a server connection run by the school, that is no longer supported.
So, you'll just have to admire the files and previews of the interfaces.
